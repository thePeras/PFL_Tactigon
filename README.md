## Project Goals

Implement a two-player board game in the Prolog language. A board game is characterized by
the type of board and pieces, the rules for moving the pieces (possible moves) and the conditions for
ending the game with defeat, victory or a draw. The game must allow three modes of use: Human/Human,
Human/Computer and Computer/Computer. At least two game levels must be included for the computer.
The implementation should also include a suitable user interface, in text mode.

We chose to implement the game [Tactigon](https://tactigongame.com/). 
Read more about the game and the project in the [report document](report.md).
